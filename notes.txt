Basic Function
    Save state

Visual Function
    Draw a window
    Draw a rectangle
    Draw a row of rectangles
    Move the rectangles
    Generate view from grid matrix

Create Naive Solution
    create function that takes game state
    finds complete path
    makes turns to follow path

Create Loop
    Pass game state into solver
    Output Visual
    has wait function to set fps
    gracefully handle error

Loop analysis
    Report number of moves, length of snake

Multiple Reports
    Setup report to accept multiple games from an outer Loop
    Report min, max, and tertiles for game length and snake length
    Parallelize running multiple games
